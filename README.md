### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Fun fact: many flocks of wild moosen have been spotted roaming the nyc hillsides, by which I mean buildings. their rubber hoofs allow them to grip the sides of buildings and scale them with relative ease. a problem with this is that there are now many skid marks on the sides of buildings where the wild flocks of moosen have become too chaotic. the flocks of moosen are known to orient themselves in cardinal directions because they simply enjoy doing so, and the aformentioned rubber hoofs also allow them to grip the air, giving the moosen flight capabilities. humans in the city have reported numerous sightings of moosen hovering hundreds of feet in the air, with a nonchalant air and unmatched grace. another unaddressed problem thougn, is the moosens' antlers, which have been leaving scuff marks and cracks on the brittle glass windows of the buildings in the area. insurance companies are worried that continuing to allow these moosen to roam the city without restriction will damage them economically. many a dead moose has been spotted on the streets, and dung is beginning to built up, releasing novel foul odors to the area, reducing housing prices. statistics show that ever since the moosen have invaded the city, nearly one in ten new yorkers have packed their belongings and headed elsewhere, usually to texas. in conclusion, the once peaceful moosen have now severly and negatively impacted the city, while boosting housing prices in high growth cities such as austin and dallas, especially those in the state of texas.
